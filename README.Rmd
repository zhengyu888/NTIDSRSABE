<h2>

An Reference-Scaled Average Bioequivalence Procedure For Therapeutic Index Drug

</h2>
The library provides data sets (internal `.rda` and in
<span title="Character Separated Variables">CSV</span>-format in
`/extdata/`) supporting users in a black-box performance qualification
(PQ) of their software installations. Users can analyze own data
imported from <span title="Character Separated Variables">CSV</span>-
and Excel-files. The methods given by the
<span title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</span> for
reference-scaling<sup id="a1">[1](#f1),</sup><sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>
are implemented.<br> Potential influence of outliers on the variability
of the reference can be assessed by box plots of studentized and
standardized residuals as suggested at a joint
<span title="European Generic Medicines Association">EGA</span>/<span title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</span>
workshop.<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup><br> Health Canada’s
approach<sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup> requiring a mixed-effects model is
approximated by intra-subject contrasts.  
Direct widening of the acceptance range as recommended by the Gulf
Cooperation Council<sup id="a5">[5](#f5)</sup> (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates) is provided as well.  
In full replicate designs the variability of test and reference
treatments can be assessed by *s*<sub>wT</sub>/*s*<sub>wR</sub> and the
upper confidence limit of *σ*<sub>wT</sub>/*σ*<sub>wR</sub> (required
for the <span title="World Health Organization">WHO</span>’s
approach<sup id="a6">[6](#f6)</sup> for reference-scaling of *AUC*).

### Methods

#### Estimation of *CV*<sub>wR</sub> (and *CV*<sub>wT</sub> in full replicate designs)

Called internally by functions `SWT()` and `SWR()`and `SWRATE()`.
where all effects are fixed (*i.e.*,
<span title="Analysis of Variance">ANOVA</span>). Estimated by the
function `lm()` of library `stats`.

``` r
SWT <- SWT(Data)
SWR <- SWR(Data)
SWRATE <- SWRATE(Data)
SWRATE2<-SWRATE2(SWT,DFCVT,SWR,DFCVR)
```

<small>[TOC ↩](#replicatebe)</small>

#### NTIDSRSABE
Called by function `NTIDSRSABE()`.  A linear
model of ilat and effects  
    *Sequence*  
where all effects are fixed (*e.g.*, by an
<span title="Analysis of Variance">ANOVA</span>). Estimated by the
function `lm()` of library `stats`.

NTIDSRSABE<-NTIDSRSABE(Data)

#### NTIDSABE
Called by function `NTIDSABE()`.  A linear
model of ilat and effects  
    *Sequence*  
where all effects are fixed (*e.g.*, by an
<span title="Analysis of Variance">ANOVA</span>). Estimated by the
function `lm()` of library `stats`.

#### ALLPK

Called by Data set `ALLPK`. A example of 4 PeriodS and 2 Sequences BE data
can be found here: <https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/31-annex-ii-statistical-analysis-bioequivalence-study-example-data-set_en.pdf>.

### Tested designs

#### Four period (full) replicates

`TRTR | RTRT`  
``` r
```

  - To use the development version, please install the released version
    from [github](https://github.com/zhengyu888/NTIDSRSABE) first to
    get its dependencies right
    [PowerTOST](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PowerTOST) ≥1.5.3,
    [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr),
    [gmodels](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gmodels)).

You need tools for building R packages from sources on your machine.
    For Windows users:  
    
      - Download
        [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) from
        <span title="The Comprehensive R Archive Network">CRAN</span>
        and follow the suggestions of the installer.
      - Install `devtools` and build the development version by:
<!-- end list

``` r
install.packages("devtools", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
devtools::install_github("zhengyu888/NTIDSRSABE")
```

## Installation

You can install the released version of NTIDSRSABE from [github](https://github.com/zhengyu888/NTIDSRSABE) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("zhengyu888/NTIDSRSABE")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(NTIDSRSABE)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
